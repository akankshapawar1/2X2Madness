I have verified all the test cases on the rubric and it all works.

Here are some of my design decisions -
1. Canvas - 700X700
2. I added white square in the config so my logic for drawing inner circles would work properly.
3. After removing the colors, I am assigning the color white. I tried using null but I ran into some problems.
4. I also made 2 separate controllers for Counter and Clockwise rotation. 
5. Instead of redrawing entire canvas after deselecting the group, I am redrawing the borders for the group and drawing 
    all the circles again.


Thank you!
